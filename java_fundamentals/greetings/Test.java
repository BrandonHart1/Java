// System.out.println - print to the console
// need to compile to run a program
        // in the console - javac FileName.java (javac Test.java)
// need semicolons after every statement
// translate the class file into machine code and execute the program - java FileName
        // in the console - java FileName (java Test)
// re-compile after every change to a file
